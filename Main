/**
 * A program based around League of Legends Esports using my arbitrary stats and biases
 * The goal is to create a tool that has metrics for each individual team and can simulate matches between them
 * Each match will be determined based on a number of stats
 * Ex. lane power (all 5 positions), teamfighting, objective control (macro), playstyle (agressive vs scaling)
 * The differential between these stats will give teams "points" towards how likely it is that they will win
 * The higher the differential between the points, the more likely it is they will win in my random simulator
 * No matches are guaranteed, otherwise all bo5's would be 3-0 and that would be boring
 * With the maximum possible differential between teams, the underdog should still have at least a 5-10% chance to win
 * Matches are always simulated individually, and can be done with or without elo in place
 * Each team should have an elo rating (probably not using elo formula, but some type of ranking to that effect)
 * This elo changes over the course of the season and can be turned on or off by the user if they are doing exhibition matches vs real simulations or predictions
 * A modifier for tournaments like a Worlds or MSI elo scaler can be applied to skew teams from major regions to have higher elo than those from minor ones
 * The team metrics can also be adjusted by the user if they want, changing their playstyle or player rankings as they see fit
