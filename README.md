# Iron-Elo-Bot
Notes for match (unimplemented):

Make a system where there are multiple "percentage" checks at critical game points where game state is evaluated

Always add a random chance to win but the odds become more skewed as more things happen (dragon buffs, heralds, barons, elder)

ELO DOES NOT AFFECT ODDS (individual team stats are the only things that affect matches)

The odds of winning an objective fight depend on playstyle, gold advantage (generated by laner advantage), previous buffs, etc.

Objective fights happen at game average times (playstle of teams doesn't affect it)

Every 5 minutes (starting at 20), there's a random chance for one team to just win the game (odds go dramatically up the more buffs and advantages one team has)

Gold advantage is calculated after 14 minutes, then after every objective fight. This affects the random odds of winning.
